## Introduction

Hello! My name is James Huff, I am an aspiring web developer. 

I have several years experience of in-person and telephonical customer service experience along with hands-on experience in efficiently managing inventory and utilizing software-driven devices to streamline operations. This taught me time management, vital communication skills with groups of people to achieve a common goal.

I also worked in the insurance industry for some time so I have experience in finding solutions to an array of complex customer situations and  following regulations. This has increased my communication skills from frontend(customer-facing) to backend(underwriters, claims representatives) and my orginizational skills as I learned to manage accounts with google sheets.

Overall my general life-long love for technology and my work experience have made me an organized, meticulous worker who has a keen since of detail, a passion for creation and a constant drive for self-improvement.

I am currently seeking a junior or entry-level position in the web development field.

## Skills

Frontend Skills:

  Through various sources online I have gained a strong understanding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

  Javascript Technologies I have familiarity but limited experience in: jQuery, SCSS/SASS, d3, React.

  I have relavent certifications in these areas viewable in my portfolio.

Backend Skills:

  I have learned the basics of php and python via Sololearn. I have found interest in these languages but I can read it better than write them for now.

  I have relavent certifications in these areas viewable in my portfolio.

## Interests

I have other interests outside of the digital realm as well but my favorite is playing music via guitar. Not only is it good for my de-stressing and maintining a healthy lifestyle but I find that daily practice keeps me sharp. Also improvization with chord progressions ands scales translates into my web development work by allowing me to approach coding challenges with fresh ideas and innovative solutions. The discipline cultivated through playing guitar can helps me stay focused, committed, and determined in with my web development projects.

In pusuit of learning and self development I am currently studying postgres, bash and sql. I am finding this enjoyable and beneficial as I wish to build full stack websites and applications.
