- 👋 Hi, I’m James!
- As a self-taught developer I’m relatively new to github but plan to master it and use it for version control over my projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Postgres, Bash and SQL via freeCodeCamp and other online sources.
- 💞️ I’m looking to start a career in web development. Currently seeking a junior-level position.
