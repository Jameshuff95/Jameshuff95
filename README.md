## Introduction

Hello! My name is James Huff, I am an aspiring web developer. I am currently taking classes at Capella University online to attain a bachelor's degree in Software Development with a focus on Web Development. 

I have several years experience of in-person and telephonical customer service experience along with hands-on experience in efficiently managing inventory and utilizing software-driven devices to streamline operations. This taught me time management, vital communication skills with groups of people to achieve a common goal.

I also worked in the insurance industry for some time so I have experience in finding solutions to an array of complex customer situations and  following regulations. This has increased my communication skills from frontend operations (customer-facing) to backend operations (underwriters, claims representatives) and my orginizational skills as I learned to manage accounts with google sheets.

Overall my general life-long love for technology and my work experience have made me an organized, meticulous worker who has a keen since of detail, a passion for creation and a constant drive for self-improvement.

I am currently seeking a junior or entry-level position in the web development field.

## Interests

I have other interests outside of the digital realm as well but my favorite is playing music via guitar. Not only is it good for my de-stressing but I find that daily practice keeps me sharp, focused, and strangely, allows me time to think about coding problems without the stress of staring at a blank screen or incorrect code. Also improvization with chord progressions ands scales translates into my web development work by allowing me to approach coding challenges with fresh ideas and innovative solutions. The discipline cultivated through playing guitar helps me stay focused, committed, and determined with my web development projects.
